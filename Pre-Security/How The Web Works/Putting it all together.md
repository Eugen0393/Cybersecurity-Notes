# 1. Putting It All Together
In short, when you request a website, your computer needs to know the IP address of the server it needs to communicate with; it uses DNS for this purpose. Then your computer communicates with the web server using a special set of commands called the HTTP protocol; the web server returns HTML, JavaScript, CSS, images, etc., which your browser then uses to properly format and display the website.

There are also several other components that help the website function more efficiently and provide additional features.
