# How Websites Work
When you visit a website, your browser (such as Safari or Google Chrome) sends a request to the web server, asking for information about the page you are visiting. The web server is simply a dedicated computer located somewhere else in the world that processes your requests.

A website consists of two main components:

1. $\color{red}{\textsf{Front End}}$ (Client-Side) - this is how the website is displayed by your browser.
2. $\color{red}{\textsf{Back End}}$ (Server-Side) - this is the server that processes your request and returns a response.
